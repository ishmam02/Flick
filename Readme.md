Website Link: https://flick-53e6b.web.app/

I would appreciate it if you visited the website link and experienced the app yourself. You can add me as a friend. My email is kabirishmam@gmail.com. I do not have notifications in my app, so if you add me, you have to let me know in someway.

I could not test my app thoroughly, so it might fail in some instances. Refreshing the page usually fixes the failure, but in some cases, I had to copy just this website link: https://flick-53e6b.web.app/ and paste it to fix the failure. 

Things I learned:
1.  A little about backend
2.  Database Designing
3.  Use firebase real-time database, firestore database, and file storage.
4.  How to deal with real-time data changes in react.js
5.  Semantic UI React for making my design process much faster

Challenges faced and how I overcame them:
1.  Firebase data storage is expensive, and at first, to be efficient, I had to store only the id of documents, so I had to make more data calls. Firebase offers two databases, so later, I decided to use both. Now I make fewer calls, and data between the two databases is appropriately synchronized. Only the user documents are in both databases. To synchronize the data, I have to update both of them when one is being updated.  
2.  Making the design responsive using CSS was hard and time-consuming and was not always perfect. React technology came in handy as it has state updates, which means when something in the state update changes, the page updates, and only the components use state updates, so it is more like a silent reload. So, whenever the window weight or height changes, my design elements change accordingly in a few places. For example, my send message form and my messages column adjust height perfectly, working well in every screen height. It almost matches the same behaviour as discord.
3.  I faced a few more challenges, but due to my experience in using react, I knew what to search for and solved them pretty quickly, and for problems relating to firebase, I used their documentation which is very good.
